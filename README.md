**Bedew** is an automated greenhouse nursery system designed to grow healthy plant saplings with minimal human intervention. The system consists of a mobile robot that cares for plants in a greenhouse environment by monitoring conditions, watering plants, seeding new pots, and moving plants as needed.

## üå± Features

- **Automated Plant Care**: Water plants based on soil moisture and plant needs
- **Intelligent Monitoring**: Track plant growth, health, and environmental conditions
- **Computer Vision**: Identify plants, assess health, and determine growth stage
- **Environment Control**: Manage temperature, humidity, and lighting for optimal growth
- **Web Interface**: Monitor and control your greenhouse from anywhere
- **Expandable**: Open architecture allows for customization and expansion

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

The Bedew system consists of two primary components:

1. **Greenhouse Controller**: Manages the greenhouse environment (temperature, humidity, lighting)
2. **Bedew Robot**: A mobile robot that navigates the greenhouse and performs plant care tasks

### Hardware Components

The system is designed to run on:
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (for the robot)
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (for the greenhouse controller)
- Custom PCBs for connecting sensors and actuators
- 3D-printed chassis and mechanical components

See the [Hardware Setup Guide](docs/hardware_setup.md) for detailed specifications and assembly instructions.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
